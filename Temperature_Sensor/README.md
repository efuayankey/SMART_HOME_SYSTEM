Project Overview: This project implements temperature sensing functionality using an MSP430 microcontroller. It demonstrates the use of the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) to read temperature values from both internal and external sensors.

Library: <msp430.h> : The core library for MSP430 microcontroller programming, providing essential functions and definitions for hardware control.

External_temperature_main.c:
This file contains the main program for reading temperature from an external sensor.

Internal_temperature_main.c
This file contains the main program for reading the MSP430's internal temperature sensor.
