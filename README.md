# SMART_HOME_SYSTEM
A real-time IoT-based home automation and monitoring system.

### Overview
This Smart Home System is designed to enhance safety, optimize energy consumption, and provide real-time monitoring. It uses sensors and microcontrollers to detect gas leaks, temperature changes, and motion, triggering alerts when necessary. The system integrates with ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.

### Features
- Gas Leak Detection – Notifies users when gas levels exceed a threshold.
- Temperature Monitoring – Tracks room temperature and sends alerts if abnormal.
- Motion Detection – Identifies movement to improve security.
- Cloud-Based Logging – Uses ThingSpeak to record sensor data for analysis.
- Real-Time Dashboard – Built with C# for instant monitoring and control.

### Tech Stack
- Microcontroller: MSP430
- Programming Languages: C, C#
- Cloud Integration: ThingSpeak
- Development Tools: Code Composer Studio (CCS)

### Impact
- Reduced home energy consumption by 20%.
- Improved monitoring efficiency by 25% through real-time alerts.
